# README

This is a small application to organize and document manual testing of software.

The aim is to give a tool to small teams where not everyone has a github account.

## Usage

If there is no users in the database any attempt to login will create a user and log you in.

After that all users can create more users. There are no ownerships and no limits for any users (That's why it only is for small teams)

If you setup github access tokens issues reported in this tool will be created as github issues.

## Deploy
